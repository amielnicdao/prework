        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Founded by former members of the band Operation Ivy, Rancid was formed in 1991 in Berkeley California.
           One of the best bands that retained its underground musical roots, Rancid has been credited
           for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. The band has had two
           lineups since its conception. Currently, their line up consists of Tim Armstrong (guitars
           and vocals), Matt Freeman (bass and vocals), and Lars Frederiksen (guitar and vocals). Brett 
           Reed was the only one who left the band and was replaced by Branden Steineckert (drums).<br><br>
